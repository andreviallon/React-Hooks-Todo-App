# React & Nodejs Todo App

A React "to-do" application.

## What I Learned

* React (functional components / React Hooks)
* State Management with React's context API
* Promise based HTTP requests with Axios
* Deploy an appliation with heroku
* The CSS Framework Bulma

## Use Case Senarios
The uers should be able to...

* Add todos to a list
* Check the todos they have completed
* Remove a todo
* See all of the todos
* Get notified when a todo has been added, deleted or if an error has occurred
